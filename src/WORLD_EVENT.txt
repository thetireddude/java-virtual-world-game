- How to trigger the event?
    Clicking the mouse anywhere on the world will trigger the "disaster" event

- What should happen when the event is triggered?
    Surrounding area/ tiles are converted to the "nether", any nearby "Dude" entities become "DudeInfected" entities
    and a "Monster" entity is spawned on a random affected tile.

- What should the affected entities do?
    The affected "DudeInfected" entities change their appearance and become infected. They start to move toward houses
    and break them down

- What should the new entity and how should it behave?
    The new entity is a "Monster" entity that spawns on a random affected tile. They hunt down "fairy" entities, and
    when they kill them, a gravestone appears on the tile they were killed.
